        Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was
        a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where
        Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode
        Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching
        the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical
        fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.
